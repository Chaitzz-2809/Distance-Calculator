# 📏 Real-Time Object Distance Detection (YOLOv8 + OpenCV)

A Computer Vision project that detects objects in real-time using **YOLOv8** and calculates the distance between them with the help of **OpenCV** and basic geometry.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Live object detection via camera  
- Calculates the distance between two objects in real-time  
- Bounding boxes, labels, and distance lines displayed on video feed  
- Focuses only on objects of interest (ignores background clutter)  
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly implementation  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy / Math library**
